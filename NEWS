0.5.20
======

* Internal changes in meego-keyboard:
  - MImKey:
    - New geometry API (MImKey::Geometry) - a key's bounding rect is now
      defined by the key's margins. Geometry can be accessed or modifed through
      ::geometry(), ::setGeometry(.), although there some convenience functions
      for key position, key width and key height. Key position refers to the 
      top left corner of the bounding rect.

  - MImKeyArea:
    - Changed key layouting. Instead of spacing between keys, the layout is now
      fully determined by key size and key margins. That is, spacing between
      two keys only depends on their pairing margins.

  - MImAbstractKeyArea:
    - Changes between different style modes (key13 and key30-key45), depending
      on how many keys a layout has. This gives tighter control over layouts.
      The old behaviour can be activated through
      "sync-style-mode-with-key-count: false;"

  - MImAbstractKeyAreaStyle:
    - Renamed row-height* to key-height*, because that's closer to reality.
    - key-height (row-height) was removed, just use key-height-medium instead.
    - padding behaviour changed:
      - padding-left overrides key-margin-left of the left-most key in a row,
      - padding-top overrides key-margin-top of all keys in top row,
      - padding-right overrides key-margin-right of the right-most key in a
        row,
      - padding-bottom overrides key-margin-bottom of all keys in bottom row.
    - size allows to override height from key area height computation, if > -1.
      Overriding width is not supported yet.

0.5.9-1
=======

* Speed typing improvements

* Internal changes in meego-keyboard:

    - KeyBinding             => MImKeyBinding
  - Cleaned up PopupBase API. It now takes a KeyButtonArea parameter, which
    enables easier communication between popup and the currently active
    KeyButtonArea; the interface consists of:
    - updatePos, cancel, handleKeyPressedOnMainArea,
      handleLongKeyPressedOnMainArea, isVisible, setEnabled

* API changes in meego-keyboard:
  - New typedef for QSharedPointer<LayoutSection> -
    LayoutData::SharedLayoutSection.
  - Switch to floating points for SWBA geometry computation.

  - KeyButtonArea:
    - updateButtonGeometries was replaced by updateButtonGeometriesForWidth,
    - buttonInformation, buttonSizeByColumn got removed.

  - LayoutSection:
    - maxNormalizedWidth returns the row width in logical units, using a key's
      width attribute.

    - spacerIndices returns a list with the position of space elements for a
      given row.

  - VKBDataKey:
    - Ctor now takes a StyleType and a SizeType parameter, too.
    - New getters (style, size, isFixedSize) for current StyleType, SizeType
      and whether to use fixed key width or (relative) scaling.
    - normalizedSize returns the key's QSizeF (queried from style and dependend
      on the SizeType).

  - SingleWidgetButtonArea, KeyButtonArea:
    - Removed updateButtonGeometries and made updateButtonGeometriesForWidth a
      pure virtual instead.

    The new style types can be referenced from CSS files, allowing for more
    flexible button styling.
  - New height attribute for row elements: small, medium (default), large,
    x-large, xx-large. The height can be used to specify the relative row
    height in CSS files (no support for fixed height yet).
  - New fixed attribute for row elements: true, false (default). It defines
    whether the row height specified in height attributes should be a relative
    or fixed value.
  - New width attribute for key elements: small, medium (default), large,
    x-large, xx-large, stretched. The new width type can be used to specify
    relative button width in CSS files (no support for fixed width yet).
  - New fixed attribute for key elements: true, false (default). It defines
    whether the button width specified in size attributes should be a relative
    or fixed value.
  - New spacer element for row elements: Spacers distribute all remaining space
    of a row among them, after the possible stretcher button has been dealt
    with.
  - The section's alignment attributes have been superseded by spacer elements,
