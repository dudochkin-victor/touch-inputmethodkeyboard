 * \brief HwKbCharacterLoops represents the hardware keyboard character loops.
 *
 * The hardware keyboard character loops store the accented characters' loops for each language.
 * In hardware keyboard state, if a character key is pressed when Sym key is held down, an accented character
 * for that letter is shown. If the same character key is pressed repeatedly holding the Sym key down,
 * the accented character will be changed to next one in a looping fashion (when last accented is reached,
 * the first is shown again).
 * The exact content of the Sym + Character loops are defined for each language.
